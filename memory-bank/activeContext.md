# Active Context: Workflow Complete

## 1. Current Focus

The end-to-end workflow for fine-tuning, conversion, and loading of models is now complete and fully tested. The primary focus has shifted to documentation and finalization.

## 2. Recent Changes

-   **LlamaBoard Deprecation:** LlamaBoard has been removed from the project due to its limitations as a non-persistent service.
-   **TensorBoard Integration:** TensorBoard has been integrated as the primary monitoring solution. This involved:
    -   Adding the `tensorboard` package to the `llama-factory/Dockerfile`.
    -   Configuring a new `tensorboard` service in `docker-compose.yml` that mounts the `./saves` directory.
    -   Updating the frontend to display the TensorBoard UI.
-   **Frontend Cleanup:** The `JobStatus` component has been removed from the frontend, and the TensorBoard UI has been moved to a more prominent position.
-   **GGUF Conversion and Ollama Loading Fixes:** Resolved numerous issues related to model merging, pathing, and file access during the GGUF conversion and Ollama loading process. This included:
    -   Correcting arguments for `convert_lora_to_gguf.py`.
    -   Ensuring correct base model path resolution within Docker containers.
    -   Implementing a waiting mechanism for GGUF file availability.
    -   Correcting the GGUF output path.
    -   Adding a crucial LoRA adapter merging step using `llamafactory-cli export`.
    -   Ensuring the full Hugging Face repository ID is used for model resolution.
    -   Correcting the path to the `convert-hf-to-gguf.py` script.
-   **Documentation Update:** The `stepbystep.md` file has been updated with detailed instructions for using the frontend, including model downloading and TensorBoard monitoring.
-   **Memory Bank Update:** All relevant Memory Bank files (`debughistory.md`, `progress.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `mermaid.mmd`) have been updated to reflect the completed workflow and debugging history.

## 3. Next Steps

The project is now in a stable, completed state. The next logical step is to ensure all documentation is up-to-date and to hand off the completed project.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

-   The orchestration model has been validated as a successful approach.
-   TensorBoard is the preferred monitoring solution due to its robustness and ability to run as a standalone service.
-   The `./saves` directory is the correct location for TensorBoard to read logs from `LLaMA-Factory`.
-   The model merging and GGUF conversion process is now robust and handles various edge cases.

## 5. Key Patterns & Preferences

-   The Memory Bank has been instrumental in tracking the project's progress and will be left in a comprehensive, up-to-date state.
-   The final architecture, with its emphasis on orchestration and leveraging specialized tools, is the recommended pattern for future development.
