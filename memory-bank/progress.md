# Progress: End-to-End Fine-Tuning Workflow

## Current Status: Workflow Complete and Documented

The end-to-end workflow for fine-tuning, merging, conversion, and loading models is now fully functional and comprehensively documented. All identified issues have been resolved, and the system is stable.

## What Works

-   The entire application stack, including the dashboard, `easy-dataset`, `LLaMA-Factory`, and `TensorBoard`, can be launched with a single `docker compose up --build -d` command.
-   The main dashboard UI is accessible and displays the status of all services.
-   The dashboard provides direct links to the `easy-dataset`, `LLaMA-Factory`, and `TensorBoard` UIs.
-   The backend service monitors the containerized services and provides status updates to the frontend.
-   The frontend UI now correctly displays the TensorBoard monitoring section.
-   The model merging, GGUF conversion, and Ollama loading process is robust and handles various pathing and dependency issues.

## Completed Tasks

1.  **TensorBoard Integration:** Replaced LlamaBoard with TensorBoard for a more persistent and reliable monitoring solution.
2.  **Frontend Cleanup:** Removed the `JobStatus` component and reorganized the UI for better clarity.
3.  **Documentation Update:** Updated all relevant Memory Bank files (`debughistory.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `mermaid.mmd`, `progress.md`, `stepbystep.md`) to reflect the new architecture and provide clear, detailed instructions for using the system.
4.  **GGUF Conversion and Ollama Loading Fixes:** Resolved numerous issues related to model merging, pathing, and file access during the GGUF conversion and Ollama loading process. This included:
    *   Correcting arguments for `convert_lora_to_gguf.py`.
    *   Ensuring correct base model path resolution within Docker containers.
    *   Implementing a waiting mechanism for GGUF file availability.
    *   Correcting the GGUF output path.
    *   Adding a crucial LoRA adapter merging step using `llamafactory-cli export`.
    *   Ensuring the full Hugging Face repository ID is used for model resolution.
    *   Correcting the path to the `convert-hf-to-gguf.py` script.
5.  **Integration Testing:** The entire workflow has been tested and is fully functional.

## Completed End-to-End Workflow

The end-to-end workflow for fine-tuning, merging, converting, and loading models is now complete. The system can successfully:
-   Fine-tune a model using `LLaMA-Factory`.
-   Monitor the fine-tuning process using TensorBoard.
-   Merge the LoRA adapter with the base model.
-   Convert the merged model to GGUF format using `llama.cpp`.
-   Load the GGUF model into Ollama with a LangChain-compatible chat template.

## Decisions Log

-   **Project Direction:** Pivoted from a complex, all-in-one application to a simple, lightweight orchestration dashboard.
-   **Core Components:** Removed the custom Celery/Redis-based data processing and fine-tuning pipeline.
-   **External Tools:** Adopted `easy-dataset` and `LLaMA-Factory` as the core engines for dataset preparation and model training, leveraging their own powerful UIs.
-   **Monitoring:** Replaced LlamaBoard with TensorBoard for a more robust and persistent monitoring solution.
-   **Architecture:** Expanded the orchestration to include `llama.cpp` for GGUF conversion and Ollama for model serving.
-   **Model Download Strategy:** Documented both direct download via LLaMA-Factory and manual `git clone` as options for obtaining base models, with `git clone` recommended for reliability.
