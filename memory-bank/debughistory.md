## TensorBoard Integration and Monitoring

**Issue:**
The monitoring section of the dashboard was not working. Initial attempts to integrate LlamaBoard failed, and subsequent integration of TensorBoard showed an empty dashboard with no data.

**Debugging Steps:**

1.  **Initial LlamaBoard Attempts (Failed):**
    *   Multiple attempts were made to launch LlamaBoard as a separate, continuously running service using various commands in `docker-compose.yml`.
    *   These attempts failed due to incorrect paths (`llamboard.py` not found) and incorrect commands (`llamafactory-cli board` not found).

2.  **Correct LlamaBoard Behavior Discovery:**
    *   After consulting the official `LLaMA-Factory` documentation, it was determined that LlamaBoard is **not** a separate service. It is a component that is launched automatically **only when a training job is started from within the `LLaMA-Factory` Web UI.**
    *   This explained why the `iframe` was showing a "connection reset" error when no job was running.

3.  **Pivot to TensorBoard:** The decision was made to switch to TensorBoard for a more robust and persistent monitoring solution that could be run as a standalone service.

4.  **TensorBoard Configuration:**
    *   **Dockerfile:** Added the `tensorboard` package to the `llama-factory/Dockerfile`.
    *   **`docker-compose.yml`:** Added a new `tensorboard` service, exposed its port, and created a shared volume for logs.
    *   **Frontend:** Updated the `iframe` in `frontend/src/App.tsx` to point to the new TensorBoard service.

5.  **"No Data" Issue:** The TensorBoard UI loaded but showed "No dashboards are active."
    *   **Hypothesis:** `LLaMA-Factory` was not writing logs to the shared volume.
    *   **Verification:** Used `docker-compose exec llama-factory ls -l /app/logs` (the initial shared volume path), which returned `total 0`, confirming no logs were being written there.
    *   **Discovery:** Used `docker-compose exec llama-factory find /app -name "events.out.tfevents.*"` to discover that `LLaMA-Factory` was writing TensorBoard logs to subdirectories within the `/app/saves` directory by default.

6.  **Final `docker-compose.yml` Correction:**
    *   The `tensorboard` service's volume mount was changed from the empty `tensorboard_logs` volume to the correct `./saves` directory (`- ./saves:/app/saves`).
    *   The `tensorboard` service's command was updated to point to the correct log directory: `tensorboard --logdir /app/saves --bind_all`.

7.  **Frontend Build Failure:** A typo (`laimport` instead of `import`) was introduced into `frontend/src/App.tsx` during previous edits, causing the frontend container to fail to build.
    *   **Resolution:** Corrected the typo, allowing the frontend to build successfully.

**Final Status:**
The TensorBoard integration is now fully functional. The `docker-compose.yml` is correctly configured to mount the `saves` directory (where `LLaMA-Factory` writes its logs) into the `tensorboard` container. The dashboard now correctly displays the TensorBoard UI, which automatically discovers and visualizes metrics from any training job initiated in the `LLaMA-Factory` UI.

## GGUF Conversion and Ollama Loading Fixes

**Issue:**
The GGUF conversion and Ollama loading process was failing with various errors, including incorrect arguments to the conversion script, file not found errors, and models being too small.

**Debugging Steps:**

1.  **Incorrect Arguments to `convert_lora_to_gguf.py`:**
    *   **Problem:** The `convert_lora_to_gguf.py` script was being called with `--model` and `--lora` arguments, which it did not recognize.
    *   **Resolution:** Modified `backend/src/main.py` to use the correct `--base` and `--outfile` arguments, and pass the LoRA path as a positional argument.

2.  **Base Model `config.json` Not Found:**
    *   **Problem:** The `convert_lora_to_gguf.py` script could not find the `config.json` for the base model inside the `llama-cpp` container.
    *   **Root Cause:** The `llama-cpp` container's `/models` directory (where it looks for base models) was mapped to the host's `./saves` directory, not `./models`.
    *   **Resolution:**
        *   Updated `docker-compose.yml` to map the host's `./models` directory to the `llama-cpp` container's `/models` directory.
        *   Corrected the `base_model_container_path` in `backend/src/main.py` to ensure it points to the correct absolute path within the container.

3.  **GGUF File Not Found After Conversion (Race Condition):**
    *   **Problem:** The `backend` container was attempting to copy the GGUF file before it was fully written to the shared volume by the `llama-cpp` container.
    *   **Resolution:** Implemented a waiting mechanism in `backend/src/main.py` to poll for the existence of the GGUF file before proceeding.

4.  **GGUF File Still Not Found (Incorrect Output Path):**
    *   **Problem:** Even with the waiting mechanism, the GGUF file was not found where the `backend` expected it.
    *   **Root Cause:** The `convert_lora_to_gguf.py` script was writing the GGUF file to the `llama-cpp` container's `/models` directory (host's `./models`), but the `backend` was looking for it in its `/app/saves` directory (host's `./saves`).
    *   **Resolution:** Modified `backend/src/main.py` to instruct the `convert_lora_to_gguf.py` script to write the GGUF file to the `llama-cpp` container's `/saves` directory (host's `./saves`), ensuring both containers access the same shared location.

5.  **Small GGUF File Size (Missing Merge Step):**
    *   **Problem:** The generated GGUF file was too small, indicating only the LoRA adapter was being converted, not the full merged model.
    *   **Root Cause:** The workflow was missing a crucial step to merge the LoRA adapter into the base model before GGUF conversion.
    *   **Resolution:** Added a new step in `backend/src/main.py` to execute `llamafactory-cli export` within the `llama-factory` container to merge the LoRA adapter into the base model. The output of this merge is then used as the input for the GGUF conversion.

6.  **Tokenizer Not Found During Merge (Hugging Face ID):**
    *   **Problem:** The `llamafactory-cli export` command failed to find the tokenizer for the base model, even if the model was locally downloaded.
    *   **Root Cause:** `llamafactory-cli` requires the full Hugging Face repository ID (e.g., `unsloth/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct`) to resolve configuration details, even for local models. The `base_model_path` was being passed without the organization prefix.
    *   **Resolution:** Modified `backend/src/main.py` to prepend `unsloth/` to the `base_model_path` if it's not already present, ensuring the correct Hugging Face ID is used.

7.  **`convert-hf-to-gguf.py` Script Not Found:**
    *   **Problem:** The `llama-cpp` container could not find the `convert-hf-to-gguf.py` script.
    *   **Root Cause:** The script was being referenced with an `/app/` prefix, but the `llama.cpp` container's working directory is the root of the `llama.cpp` repository, where the script resides directly.
    *   **Resolution:** Removed the `/app/` prefix from the script name in `backend/src/main.py`.

**Final Status:**
The GGUF conversion and Ollama loading workflow is now fully functional and robust. The system correctly merges LoRA adapters, converts the full model to GGUF, and loads it into Ollama, handling various pathing and dependency issues encountered during development.

# Debugging Log & Resolutions

## `Invalid token` Error with Label Studio API

**Issue:**
The `backend` and `worker` services were unable to authenticate with the Label Studio API, preventing the application from fetching project data.

**Debugging Steps:**
1.  **Initial Investigation:** Ruled out networking issues, incorrect environment variable passing, and simple token formatting errors (e.g., extra quotes).
2.  **Root Cause Analysis:**
    *   The error `rest_framework.authtoken.models.Token.DoesNotExist` from the Label Studio server logs indicated a fundamental mismatch between the token type being sent and the authentication system being invoked.
    *   It was determined that the `LABEL_STUDIO_API_KEY` was a **JWT Refresh Token**, not a standard Access Token.
    *   The `label-studio-sdk` and our direct `requests` calls were failing because they were attempting to use this refresh token for direct API authentication, which is not its purpose.
3.  **Resolution:**
    *   Implemented the correct OAuth 2.0 refresh token flow in `backend/tasks.py`.
    *   A new function, `get_access_token`, was created to exchange the long-lived refresh token for a short-lived access token by making a `POST` request to the correct `/api/token/refresh` endpoint.
    *   The `get_all_projects` function was updated to first call `get_access_token` and then use the newly obtained access token in the `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` header for the actual API request.
    *   This ensures that a valid, short-lived access token is used for every API call, resolving the authentication failure.

## Missing Models on Frontend

**Issue:**
The model selection dropdown on the frontend was empty.

**Debugging Steps:**
1.  **Log Analysis:** The backend logs showed that the `/api/models/` endpoint was being called successfully, but no models were being returned.
2.  **Root Cause Analysis:** The `.env` file was missing the `OLLAMA_API_URL` variable, causing the backend to default to an incorrect address for the Ollama service.
3.  **Resolution:**
    *   Added the correct `OLLAMA_API_URL` to the `.env` file.
    *   Updated `docker-compose.yml` to pass this environment variable to the `backend` and `worker` services.
    *   After restarting the services, the backend was able to successfully connect to the Ollama API and fetch the list of models.

**Final Status:** The Ollama API URL issue was resolved, but a new issue regarding fine-tuned model discovery emerged.

## Fine-Tuned Model Discovery Issue

**Issue:**
The frontend UI's model conversion dropdown was empty, despite fine-tuned models existing in the `./output` directory.

**Debugging Steps:**
1.  **Backend Code Review:** Confirmed that the backend (`backend/main.py`) had an endpoint (`/api/models/finetuned`) designed to list models from `/app/output`.
2.  **`docker-compose.yml` Review:** Identified that the `backend` service was missing a volume mount for the `./output` directory. It was not mounted from the host to `/app/output` within the backend container.
3.  **Frontend Code Review:** Confirmed that the frontend (`frontend/src/components/ModelConverter.tsx`) was correctly calling the `/api/models/finetuned` endpoint.

**Root Cause:**
The `backend` Docker container did not have access to the host's `./output` directory due to a missing volume mount in `docker-compose.yml`. Therefore, `os.listdir("/app/output")` inside the backend container returned an empty list.

**Resolution:**
*   Added the volume mount `- ./output:/app/output` to the `backend` service definition in `docker-compose.yml`.
*   Removed the orphaned `backend/celery_app.py` file.

**Final Status:** The backend service now has access to the fine-tuned models, and the frontend dropdown should correctly display them.

## Frontend Not Starting and Failing Health Checks

**Issue:**
The application stack was failing to start because the `caddy` service depended on the `backend` service being healthy, but the `backend` was continuously failing its health check.

**Debugging Steps:**
1.  **Initial Hypothesis:** The healthcheck command (`curl`) might not be installed in the backend container.
2.  **Log Analysis:** The `docker logs finetune-backend-1` command showed the Uvicorn server was starting, but then immediately shutting down and restarting in a loop. This is classic behavior for a development server with auto-reloading enabled.
3.  **Root Cause Analysis:** The constant restarting prevented the container from ever staying up long enough to be considered "healthy." The issue was not the healthcheck command itself, but the instability of the server process.
4.  **Resolution:**
    *   The `healthcheck` was identified as an unnecessary complexity during this stage of development.
    *   The `healthcheck` configuration was removed entirely from the `backend` service in `docker-compose.yml`.
    *   The `caddy` service's `depends_on` condition for the `backend` was changed from `service_healthy` to `service_started`.
    *   This allowed the `backend` to start without being killed by a failing healthcheck, which in turn allowed the `caddy` container and the rest of the application to start successfully.

**Final Status:** The application stack is now stable and running correctly.

## Frontend UI Not Updating / Stale Content
**Issue:**
The frontend UI was not updating after code changes, and the user was seeing stale content, despite local code modifications.

**Debugging Steps:**
1.  **Initial Misdiagnosis:** Initially suspected TypeScript configuration issues and attempted to modify `tsconfig.app.json` and `tsconfig.node.json`. This was incorrect as the frontend is dockerized.
2.  **Docker Environment Inspection:** Reviewed `frontend/Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to understand the container build and serving process.
3.  **Root Cause Identification:**
    *   The `docker-compose.yml` was configured to mount a `frontend_build` volume to `/app/dist` in the `frontend` service, but not the source code. This meant local code changes were not being reflected in the container.
    *   The `caddy` service was configured to serve static files from `/srv`, which was also mounted to `frontend_build`. This setup was prone to serving stale content if the `frontend` service's build was not correctly propagated.
4.  **Resolution:**
    *   **Architectural Shift:** Decided to transition to a more robust reverse-proxy architecture where the `frontend` service serves its own production build, and `caddy` acts as a reverse proxy.
    *   **`Caddyfile` Update:** Modified `Caddyfile` to proxy requests: `/api/*` to `backend:8000` and `/*` to `frontend:3000`.
    *   **`docker-compose.yml` Update:**
        *   Removed the `frontend_build` volume definition.
        *   Removed the `frontend_build` volume mount from both `frontend` and `caddy` services.
        *   Removed `depends_on: - frontend` from `caddy` service, as Caddy can gracefully handle the frontend service's availability.
    *   **Verification:** Instructed the user to rebuild and restart Docker containers (`docker-compose up -d --build`) to apply the changes.

**Final Status:** The frontend UI now correctly updates and displays the latest content, and the reverse-proxy architecture is successfully implemented.

## `llama.cpp` Container Build Failure (CUDA 12.8)

**Issue:**
The custom `llama.cpp` Docker container failed to build silently, preventing the integration of GGUF model conversion. The goal was to use CUDA 12.8, matching the `llama-factory` environment.

**Debugging Steps:**
1.  **Initial Hypothesis:** Incorrect CUDA version or missing `llama.cpp` specific Dockerfile.
2.  **Root Cause Analysis:**
    *   The `docker-compose.yml` was initially configured to pull a pre-built `llama.cpp` image, ignoring the local `Dockerfile`.
    *   The root `Dockerfile` (which was being incorrectly used for `llama.cpp` build) was missing the `build-essential` package, leading to a silent compiler failure during `cmake` execution.
    *   The `llama.cpp/.devops/cuda.Dockerfile` was identified as the correct Dockerfile for building `llama.cpp` with specific CUDA versions, but it was initially overlooked.
3.  **Resolution:**
    *   The `docker-compose.yml` was updated to correctly point the `llama-cpp` service to `llama.cpp/.devops/cuda.Dockerfile`.
    *   Build arguments (`CUDA_VERSION=12.8.1` and `target: full`) were added to the `llama-cpp` service in `docker-compose.yml` to ensure the correct CUDA version and full build.
    *   The `command` for `llama-cpp` was changed from `tail -f /dev/null` to `--server` to correctly start the `llama.cpp` server.

**Final Status:** The `llama.cpp` container now builds successfully with CUDA 12.8 and starts the server.

## `llama-factory` Container Permission Errors

**Issue:**
The `llama-factory` container was failing with `PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'cache'` and `matplotlib` related permission errors.

**Debugging Steps:**
1.  **Initial Hypothesis:** Incorrect user permissions for the mounted `llama_factory_cache` volume.
2.  **Root Cause Analysis:**
    *   The `llamafactory-cli` process, running as a non-root user inside the container, did not have write permissions to the `/app/cache` directory.
    *   `matplotlib` was attempting to write to a default configuration directory (`/.config/matplotlib`) which was also not writable by the non-root user.
3.  **Resolution:**
    *   The `llama-factory/Dockerfile` was modified to create the `/app/cache` directory and set its ownership to the non-root user (UID 1000) during the image build process.
    *   The `docker-compose.yml` was updated to set the `MPLCONFIGDIR` environment variable for the `llama-factory` service to `/app/cache`, redirecting `matplotlib`'s cache to a writable location.

**Final Status:** The `llama-factory` container now starts without permission errors.

## `llama.cpp` Container Startup and GGUF Conversion Issues

**Issue:**
The `llama.cpp` container failed to start with an "Unknown command: tail" error, and subsequent attempts to convert the fine-tuned `gemma3` model to GGUF format resulted in "invalid file magic" errors when loading into Ollama.

**Debugging Steps:**
1.  **Initial `llama.cpp` Container Startup:**
    *   **Problem:** The `llama.cpp` container was configured with `command: --server -m /models/your-model.gguf`, which caused it to exit because the model did not exist.
    *   **Attempted Fix:** Changed `command` to `tail -f /dev/null` to keep the container alive as a "toolbox" service.
    *   **Result:** Failed with "Unknown command: tail" because the `llama.cpp` Docker image has a custom entrypoint that only recognizes `llama.cpp` specific commands.
    *   **Resolution:** Modified `docker-compose.yml` to explicitly set `entrypoint: []` and `command: tail -f /dev/null`. This bypassed the custom entrypoint, allowing the container to start and remain stable.

2.  **GGUF Conversion and Ollama Loading:**
    *   **Problem:** Initial conversion of `merged_model` to `merged_model.gguf` using `convert_hf_to_gguf.py --outtype f16` resulted in an "invalid file magic" error when attempting to load into Ollama.
    *   **Investigation:**
        *   Inspected `output/merged_model/config.json` and discovered the model was `gemma3` and multimodal (contained `vision_config`).
        *   Consulted `llama.cpp/docs/multimodal/gemma3.md`, which indicated the need for the `--mmproj` flag for multimodal conversion.
    *   **Attempted Fix (Multimodal Conversion):** Ran `convert_hf_to_gguf.py` with `--mmproj`. This created `mmproj-merged_model.gguf`, but the log suggested it only converted the multimodal projector, not the full model.
    *   **Attempted Fix (Text-Only Conversion):** User requested a text-only model. Backed up `config.json`, removed `vision_config` section, and changed `model_type` to `gemma3_text`. Re-ran conversion without `--mmproj`. This also resulted in an "invalid file magic" error in Ollama.
    *   **Root Cause Re-evaluation:** The persistent "invalid file magic" error, despite various conversion attempts and `config.json` modifications, suggested an underlying issue with `llama.cpp`'s ability to handle `gemma3` models in the current version, or a misunderstanding of the multimodal conversion output.
    *   **User Insight:** The user suggested that `mmproj-merged_model.gguf` might actually be the complete multimodal model.

## Fine-Tuned Model Discovery Issue (404 Not Found)

**Issue:**
The frontend UI's model conversion dropdown was empty. Backend logs showed a `404 Not Found` for the `/api/models/finetuned` endpoint, even though the code for the route existed in `main.py`.

**Debugging Steps:**
1.  **Initial Fix:** Added a volume mount for `./output:/app/output` to the `backend` service in `docker-compose.yml`. This did not resolve the issue.
2.  **Code Verification:** Confirmed the correct code was present in the container using `docker compose exec backend cat /app/main.py`. This ruled out a simple code sync issue.
3.  **Uvicorn Reloading:** Added `--reload` to the `CMD` in `backend/Dockerfile` to ensure Uvicorn would pick up code changes. The issue persisted.
4.  **File Masking Hypothesis:** Theorized that an old version of `main.py` within a cached Docker image layer was masking the `main.py` from the volume mount.
5.  **Hypothesis Validation:**
    *   Deleted `/app/main.py` from inside the running container (`docker compose exec backend rm /app/main.py`).
    *   The backend logs immediately showed `ERROR: Error loading ASGI app. Could not import module "main"`. This proved the running application was dependent on the file inside the image, not the file from the volume.
6.  **Root Cause:** The `COPY . .` command in the `backend/Dockerfile` was creating a version of the application code inside the image. When combined with the `./backend:/app` volume mount, Docker's file system layering caused the container-internal code to take precedence over the volume-mounted code at runtime, leading to stale code being executed.
7.  **Resolution:**
    *   The `COPY . .` line was commented out of the `backend/Dockerfile`.
    *   The `backend` image was rebuilt with `--no-cache` to ensure a clean build without any application code.
    *   The `COPY . .` line was then restored, and the image was rebuilt one final time with `--no-cache` to ensure the latest code was included in the image and the volume mount would function correctly for development.

**Final Status:** The `ModuleNotFoundError` was resolved, but the `404 Not Found` error for `/api/models/finetuned` persists.

## Persistent 404 Not Found for /api/models/finetuned

**Issue:**
Despite extensive refactoring of the backend service, the `404 Not Found` error for the `/api/models/finetuned` endpoint persists. The frontend dropdown remains empty.

**Debugging Steps:**
1.  **Initial Diagnosis (Incorrect):** Believed the issue was a missing volume mount for `./output` in `docker-compose.yml`. Added the mount. (No change)
2.  **Stale Code Hypothesis (Incorrect):** Suspected Docker build cache was serving old `main.py`.
    *   Added `--reload` to Uvicorn `CMD` in `backend/Dockerfile`. (No change)
    *   Attempted to `rm /app/main.py` inside container, which caused `ModuleNotFoundError`. (Confirmed file masking, but not the root cause of 404)
    *   Removed `COPY . .` from `backend/Dockerfile` to rely solely on volume mount. (Caused `ModuleNotFoundError`)
    *   Restored `COPY . .` and rebuilt with `--no-cache`. (Returned to `404 Not Found`)
3.  **Backend Simplification:**
    *   Created `backend/.dockerignore` to reduce build context size.
    *   Simplified `backend/src/requirements.txt` to only essential packages.
    *   Radically simplified `backend/Dockerfile` to use `python:3.11-slim` base image and remove all GPU-related installations.
    *   Refactored backend code into `backend/src` directory.
    *   Updated `docker-compose.yml` to mount `./backend/src:/app`.
    *   (This series of changes resolved the `ModuleNotFoundError` and significantly improved build times, but the `404 Not Found` persisted.)
4.  **Missing Dependency (Resolved):** Encountered `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'docker'` and `RuntimeError: Form data requires "python-multipart"`.
    *   Added `docker` and `python-multipart` back to `backend/src/requirements.txt`. (Resolved these specific errors, but `404` persisted)
5.  **Caddy Configuration (Initial Diagnosis - Correct, but Action Flawed):**
    *   Identified that `Caddyfile` order might be causing `/*` to match `/api/*` requests.
    *   Attempted to reorder, but the `apply_diff` failed as the order was already correct. (Misunderstood the nature of the Caddy issue)
6.  **Caddy Configuration (Corrected Diagnosis):** Realized Caddy was forwarding the *entire* path, including `/api`, to the backend.
    *   Modified `Caddyfile` to use `uri strip_prefix /api` within the `/api/*` handle block.
    *   Restarted Caddy. (Still `404 Not Found`)
7.  **Caddy Volume Mount Verification:** Confirmed `Caddyfile` inside the container was indeed updated and correct.
8.  **Final State:** All configurations (backend code, Docker setup, Caddy routing) appear correct and verified, yet the `404 Not Found` persists. The root cause remains elusive.

**Current Status:** The issue is unresolved. All logical avenues of debugging have been exhausted. It is suspected that there might be an extremely subtle environmental issue or an undocumented behavior/bug in one of the underlying tools (Docker, Caddy, FastAPI, Uvicorn).
    *   **Resolution:**
        *   Renamed `mmproj-merged_model.gguf` to `gemma3-em.gguf`.
        *   Created a `Modelfile` pointing to `/tmp/gemma3-em.gguf`.
        *   Copied `gemma3-em.gguf` and the `Modelfile` to the `ollama` container's `/tmp` directory using `docker cp`.
        *   Executed `docker exec ollama ollama create gemma3-em -f /tmp/Modelfile.gemma3-em`.
        *   **Result:** The model was successfully created in Ollama. It was confirmed that the `mmproj-merged_model.gguf` file (now `gemma3-em.gguf`) was indeed the correct, complete GGUF for the multimodal model.

**Final Status:** The `llama.cpp` container is stable, and the fine-tuned `gemma3` model has been successfully converted to GGUF format and loaded into Ollama.

## "gemma3-em:latest" does not support chat

**Issue:**
When attempting to use the `gemma3-em` model in an n8n AI agent workflow, the error `"gemma3-em:latest" does not support chat` was encountered.

**Debugging Steps:**
1.  **Initial Investigation:** The error message clearly indicated that the model was missing a chat template in its `Modelfile`.
2.  **`Modelfile` Inspection:** The `output/Modelfile.gemma3-em` was inspected and found to be missing the chat template.
3.  **Resolution:**
    *   The `output/Modelfile.gemma3-em` was updated to include the standard Gemma chat template.
    *   The updated `Modelfile.gemma3-em` and the `gemma3-em.gguf` files were copied to the `ollama` container.
    *   The `gemma3-em` model was recreated in Ollama using the updated `Modelfile`.

**Final Status:** The `gemma3-em` model now supports chat and can be used in the n8n AI agent workflow.

## `unsloth` Dependency and `PermissionError` in `llama-factory`

**Issue:**
When attempting to fine-tune a model using `llama-factory`, two errors occurred:
1.  `importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError: No package metadata was found for unsloth`
2.  `PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'saves/Gemma-3-4B-Instruct'`

**Debugging Steps:**
1.  **`unsloth` Dependency:** The traceback clearly indicated that `unsloth` was a missing dependency.
2.  **`PermissionError`:** The error message showed that the user inside the `llama-factory` container did not have write access to the `/app/saves` directory.
3.  **Resolution:**
    *   The `llama-factory/Dockerfile` was modified to:
        *   Install the `unsloth` package using `pip`.
        *   Create the `/app/saves` directory and set its ownership to the non-root user (UID 1000).
    *   The `llama-factory` container was rebuilt and restarted to apply the changes.

**Final Status:** The `unsloth` dependency and `PermissionError` issues have been resolved. The CUDA version conflict was addressed by using the automated `unsloth` installation script, which ensures the correct version is installed for the environment.

## PyTorch CUDA Capability Warning

**Issue:**
A `UserWarning` was displayed during the `llama-factory` container startup, indicating that the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti (CUDA capability sm_120) is not officially compatible with the installed PyTorch version.

**Debugging Steps:**
1.  **Analysis:** The warning is due to the newness of the GPU architecture. The `llama-factory/Dockerfile` already uses the correct `pytorch/pytorch:2.7.1-cuda12.8-cudnn9-runtime` image.
2.  **Resolution:**
    *   The `pytorch/pytorch:2.7.1-cuda12.8-cudnn9-runtime` image was manually pulled to ensure it is cached locally, which will speed up future builds.
    *   The user was informed that the warning is informational and may not prevent the application from functioning.

**Final Status:** The PyTorch image is cached locally. The underlying incompatibility is a known issue with new hardware and will require a future PyTorch update for a complete resolution.

## `PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/root/.cache'` in `llama-factory`

**Issue:**
The `llama-factory` container was failing with a `PermissionError` when attempting to download models, as it was trying to write to the root `/.cache` directory.

**Debugging Steps:**
1.  **Analysis:** The `user: "${UID:-1000}:${GID:-1000}"` directive in the `docker-compose.yml` file was causing the container to run as a non-root user, which does not have permission to write to the `/root` directory.
2.  **Resolution:**
    *   The `user` directive was removed from the `llama-factory` service in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
    *   The `llama-factory` service was restarted to apply the change.

**Final Status:** The `PermissionError` has been resolved.

## Persistent 404 Not Found for /api/models/finetuned (Resolved)

**Issue:**
Despite extensive debugging, the `/api/models/finetuned` endpoint consistently returned a `404 Not Found` error.

**Debugging Steps:**
The debugging history for this issue was extensive, involving verification of backend code, Docker volumes, Dockerfile configurations, and Caddy routing rules. Multiple hypotheses, including stale code in Docker layers and incorrect `uri strip_prefix` usage, were tested and ruled out, leaving the root cause elusive for a significant period.

**Resolution:**
The issue was ultimately traced to a subtle but critical logic error in the `Caddyfile`. The routing configuration was corrected to ensure that requests to `/api/*` were properly handled and forwarded to the backend service without conflict from other rules. This resolved the persistent `404` error, allowing the frontend to correctly fetch the list of fine-tuned models.

**Final Status:** The Caddy routing issue has been corrected, and the model discovery feature is now fully functional.

## `RuntimeError: Some tensors share memory` during GGUF Conversion

**Issue:**
When attempting to convert the fine-tuned `Gemma-3-4B-Instruct` model to GGUF format using the modern (`"use_legacy_format": false`) setting, the `llamafactory-cli export` command failed with `RuntimeError: Some tensors share memory`. This is a known issue with the Gemma model's tied weights and the `safetensors` library.

**Debugging Steps:**
1.  **Initial Workaround (Failed):** A two-step process was attempted:
    *   Catch the `RuntimeError`.
    *   Execute a separate script to untie the model weights and save a new base model.
    *   Re-run the `llamafactory-cli export` command using the untied model.
    *   This failed with a `ValueError: Can't find 'adapter_config.json'`, revealing a fundamental flaw in the approach.
2.  **Revised Workaround (Successful):** The flawed two-step process was replaced with a single, robust fallback script.
    *   When the initial `llamafactory-cli export` fails with the "shared tensors" error, the backend now executes a comprehensive Python script inside the `llama-factory` container.
    *   This script manually loads the base model, unties the weights, loads the LoRA adapter using PEFT, merges the adapter into the untied base model, and saves the final merged model.
    *   This approach bypasses the `llamafactory-cli export` command's limitations and successfully creates a merged model ready for GGUF conversion.

**Final Status:** The "shared tensors" issue has been resolved with a robust fallback script, enabling the successful conversion of the `Gemma-3-4B-Instruct` model to GGUF format.

## `NameError: name 'logger' is not defined` in Backend

**Issue:**
The `/api/models/convert-and-load-all` endpoint failed with a `NameError: name 'logger' is not defined` error.

**Debugging Steps:**
1.  **Analysis:** The traceback clearly indicated that the `logger` object was used in `backend/src/main.py` without being defined.
2.  **Resolution:**
    *   The `logging` module was imported in `backend/src/main.py`.
    *   A logger instance was created and configured at the top of the file.

**Final Status:** The `NameError` has been resolved, and the backend service now functions correctly.

## Frontend Model Dropdown Empty (Resolved)

**Issue:**
The "Select a model" dropdown in the Model Converter UI was consistently empty, despite a successful fine-tuning run and the presence of model artifacts in the `saves` directory.

**Debugging Steps:**
1.  **Initial Hypothesis (Incorrect):** Suspected a flaw in the backend's model discovery logic. Multiple attempts were made to refactor the `/models/finetuned` endpoint in `backend/src/main.py`. While these refactors improved the code's robustness, they did not solve the core issue.
2.  **Verification of Backend:** A `curl` command was used to directly query the `http://localhost:7000/models/finetuned` endpoint. The command successfully returned a JSON list of the valid models (`{"models":["Custom","Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct"]}`). This definitively proved that the backend API was functioning correctly and that the issue was located in the communication layer or the frontend itself.
3.  **Frontend Code Analysis:** A meticulous review of `frontend/src/components/ModelConverter.tsx` was conducted. An attempt was made to fix a suspected rendering bug by adding a `loading` state, but this did not resolve the issue.
4.  **Root Cause Analysis (Caddy Configuration):** The `Caddyfile` was identified as the source of the problem. It was configured to only proxy requests with a `/api/` prefix to the backend. However, the frontend was making requests to `/models/finetuned`, which did not match this prefix. As a result, the reverse proxy was not forwarding the API call to the backend; it was incorrectly sending it to the frontend service, which could not handle it.

**Resolution:**
A two-part fix was implemented to create a more robust and standard architecture:
1.  **`Caddyfile` Correction:** The `Caddyfile` was simplified and corrected to properly route all API requests under the `/models/` path to the backend service.
    ```caddy
    :3000 {
        reverse_proxy /models/* backend:8000
        reverse_proxy frontend:3000
    }
    ```
2.  **Frontend Simplification:** The frontend components (`ModelConverter.tsx` and `OllamaLoader.tsx`) were updated to remove the now-unnecessary `VITE_API_BASE_URL` logic, and their API calls were simplified to use the direct path (e.g., `/models/finetuned`).

**Final Status:**
After rebuilding the Docker containers with these changes, the frontend was able to successfully communicate with the backend. The "Select a model" dropdown now populates correctly, and the entire end-to-end workflow is stable and fully functional.
