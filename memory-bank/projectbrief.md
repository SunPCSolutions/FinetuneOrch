# Project Brief: Fine-Tuning Orchestration Dashboard

## 1. Project Goal

To develop a simple, web-based orchestration dashboard that simplifies the process of using `easy-dataset` and `LLaMA-Factory` for fine-tuning language models.

## 2. Core Problem

Using standalone tools like `easy-dataset` and `LLaMA-Factory` requires managing multiple services and monitoring their logs and status independently. This project aims to unify this workflow into a single, cohesive dashboard, providing a centralized point of control and observation.

## 3. Key Features

-   **Service Orchestration:** Provide a unified view to monitor the status of the `easy-dataset` and `LLaMA-Factory` services.
-   **Centralized Monitoring:** Aggregate and display logs from all relevant services in a single, easy-to-use web interface.
-   **Simplified Workflow:** Guide the user through the process of launching the services, preparing data, initiating fine-tuning, converting the model to GGUF, and loading it into Ollama.
-   **Containerized Deployment:** Package the entire application stack using Docker for easy and reproducible deployment.

## 4. Target Users

-   Developers and researchers who want a simplified, GUI-driven workflow for fine-tuning models using `LLaMA-Factory`.
-   Users who want to avoid the complexity of managing multiple command-line services.

## 5. Success Metrics

-   Ease of use: A user can successfully launch the services and start a fine-tuning job with minimal instruction.
-   Stability and reliability of the orchestration dashboard.
-   Clear and effective presentation of service status and logs.
